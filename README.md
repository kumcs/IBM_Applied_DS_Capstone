# Space Launch Company Capstone Project

## About This Capstone Project

Welcome to the Space Launch Company Capstone Project! This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for a comprehensive data science project aimed at solving real-world challenges for a private space launch company. 

### Project Objectives

The goal of this capstone project is to demonstrate data science skills by:

1. **Collecting Data**  
   Gathering relevant datasets from multiple sources to ensure a robust analysis foundation.

2. **Data Wrangling**  
   Cleaning and transforming raw data to improve quality and prepare it for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Exploring processed data to uncover patterns and insights. SQL queries will be used to extract meaningful information.

4. **Statistical Analysis & Visualization**  
   Applying statistical methods to identify relationships between variables and using data visualization to communicate findings.

5. **Data Grouping**  
   Segmenting data based on categorical variables to gain deeper insights.

6. **Predictive Modeling**  
   Building, evaluating, and refining predictive models to extract actionable insights.

7. **Final Presentation**  
   Crafting a comprehensive presentation to narrate the analysis process and key findings.

### Key Features of This Repository
- **Code**: Scripts for data collection, wrangling, analysis, and modeling.
- **Datasets**: Raw and processed datasets used in the project.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of methods, analyses, and results.
